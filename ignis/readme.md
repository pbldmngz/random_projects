Se pretende que este programa cambie entre escenas del OBS Studio basándose en el sonido del micrófono

> Edit 2023/05/15: I remember this thing. Basically I created 4 scenes in OBS studio, each had a higher intensity vibe, with fire and all that thing, so if I screamed too much it started switching the scenes, making it look like some kind of fire/rage animation. It was really cool.

# Random stuff
> This is just a lot of stuff Ill be creating to improve myself or to lose time instead of studiying for my 3 exams dated tomorrow.

## Index
1. Useful calculator (instead of using eval, I created the function) with interface.
2. Animated binary calculator (shows how the progress is done and use console colors).
3. Simple auto-screenshot (I dont really remember why i did this, i think it was to take specific captures of a game for an advanced no recoil script)
4. Lua no-recoil (This aint advanced at all but it was my firt steeps in LUA)
5. Menu item separator (I had to do a restaurant chat on an way-to-specific format so I did this and solved the issue in few minutes)
6. Simple list to java (Clears formating in copy-pasted lists so you can create an array with them)
7. No trashtalk (Stupid ass web program that screams like ahigh pitch goat every time you say a bad word. Trust me, I absolutelly needed it at that moment)

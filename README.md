# Random stuff
> This is just a lot of programs Ill be creating to improve myself or to lose time instead of studiying for my 3 exams dated tomorrow.

## Index (Not updated)
1. **Useful calculator** (instead of using eval, I created the function) with interface.
2. **Animated binary calculator** (shows how the progress is done and use console colors).
3. **Simple auto-screenshot** (I dont really remember why i did this, i think it was to take specific captures of a game for an advanced no recoil script).
4. **Lua no-recoil** (This aint advanced at all but it was my firt steeps in LUA).
5. **Menu item separator** (I had to do a restaurant chat on an way-to-specific format so I did this and solved the issue in few minutes).
6. **Simple list to java** (Clears formating in copy-pasted lists so you can create an array with them).
7. **No trashtalk** (Stupid ass web program that screams like a high pitch goat every time you say a bad word. Trust me, I absolutelly needed it at that moment).
8. **Line counter for repository** (Pass a PATH as an input and it will flood search every file with the input EXTENSION, ej: js, py, jar... And it will count the lines of them all)
